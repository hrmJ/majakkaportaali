Be all end all


Be all, end all
Start me, Finnish me
Be all end all

Center of attention, night and day
I just lean on every word You say
Thoughts just running out and inside me
how can You have all this time for me

You spent all day
to watch my life
to start my 
da diiidadaaaa

Be all, end all
Start me, Finnish me
Be all end all
